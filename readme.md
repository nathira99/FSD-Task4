# Income Expense Calculator

## Project Overview

This is a **Income Expense Calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS or TailwindCSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The goal of this project is to help users keep track of their finances by recording income and expense entries. It provides a clear view of their financial health with a running total of income, expenses, and balance.

This app allows users to:
- Add income or expense records
- View a dynamic list of all entries
- Edit or delete any entry
- Filter records by type (income, expense, or all)
- Store their data in the browser using **LocalStorage** so it remains available even after a page refresh
